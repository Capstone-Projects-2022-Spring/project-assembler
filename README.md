## Overview

Assembler is a 2D open world strategy survival building game that implements multiplayer, sandbox, and single player capabilities with different game modes. The player will start on a randomly generated map given some starter items (a low level gun for defense and an axe for mining) for survival, along with the ability for other players to join this session. The end goal of the game is to survive against the AI controlled enemy targeting the base of the player.

## Gameplay

The player will start with basic tools to find the resources that include raw materials such as iron and copper or items to acquire from the world by traversing it. The incentives for the player will be given through the game by viewing a tech tree for the player to access at any time that guides through their strategic planning of their building bases. Our tech tree is a tree where each node represents a specific weapon, item, advancement, or structure that helps with the progression of the game. Moreover, the AI will use pathfinding to attack the player in swarms, which adds an extra layer of difficulty.
